# React weather app

A simple application for checking out the current temperature in different places in the world.

Here are some of the tools I used:

* React - this was the Javascript framework used.
* Open Weather Map - I used Open Weather Map to search for weather data by city name.
* Webpack - this was used to bundle all css and js assets.

## Running the app
* fetch repository
* `npm install`
* `webpack --mode=development`
* `node server.js`

Your app should be running on `localhost:3000`
